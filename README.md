# CSIT_415
Repository for group project. Application Name:  **New Journey**

Changes Made: I created the repository and named it CSIT415. Next, created a branch named ClassAssignment. After that, I created a new file to just type anything and play around with the repository,
but I didn't realize I was working in the main branch and not the branch I created for the assignment. So I had to redo it in the other branch. I was also editing in the README.md instead of an actual file.
I had to correct that as well. I took screenshots and will now submit the assignment.
